# WhiteMap
Hi, I am [Faisal Manzer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/faisal-manzer)

I created WhiteMap as a fun project during my travels. In high school, I used HTML Canvas to develop a game called [iWar](https://github.com/Faisal-Manzer/iWar). After discovering **Microsoft Whiteboard**, I was inspired to take on the exciting challenge of building my own drawing tool.
